      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">In the Spring of 2019, my best friends and I decided to take a two week trip to explore Japan!  
         Additionally, I had a friend living in Melbourne, Australia at the time so I thought it would be perfect to 
         continue my overseas trip to visit her!  (I was going to be in the same hemisphere after all).
         After months of planning, my husband, my best friend from grade school and a close college friend 
         embarked on a trip of a life time! </p>

                  <h2>Tokyo, Japan</h2>
                  <p>
                     The first stop on our journey was the quintessential Japanese city, Tokyo!  We explored 
                     many different neighborhoods and ate so much amazing food!

                  <h2>Takayama, Japan</h2>
                  <p>
                     Our next stop was a trip into the gorgeous Japanese Alps.  There, we explored the ancient city of 
                     Sanmachi Suji.

                  <p>
                     We then took a bus trip further into the mountains to stay at a Japanese Ryokan and experience the 
                     healing properties of natural hotsprings and enjoy their rotemburos (outdoor baths) with beautiful
                     views of the surrounding mountains.

                  <h2>Kyoto, Japan</h2>
                  <p>
                   Next stop, Kyoto!  We were able to explore beautiful temples, shrines and bamboo groves.
                   My travel partners and I took in a Japanese culture show and learned how to participate in 
                   a traditional Japanese tea ceremony.  We also rocked the house AGAIN in a private Karaoke suite!

               <h2>Osaka, Japan</h2>
               <p>
                  Thanks to Japan's amazing public transport, we were able to take a day trip from Kyoto to visit 
                  the port city of Osaka.  We explored the numerous fish markets and sampled some of the freshest 
                  sushi we will ever have in our lives!  We then got to explore the famous Osaka Castle, first built 
                  in 1580!

               <h2>Back to Tokyo, Japan!</h2>
               <p>
                  Even though we were sad our Japan trip was coming to a close, we still had a few more days to
                  further explore Tokyo!  We spent the rest of our time exploring a digital art museum, visiting a Kawaii
                  Monster Cafe, eating plenty of sushi and singing our hearts out at more Karaoke bars!

               <h2>Melbourne, Australia</h2>
               <p> After saying goodbye to my friends, I took a nine hour plane trip to
                  Melbourne, Australia!  I explored the city with my best friend from college, shopped at thrift 
                  stores and the famous Woolworths supermarket.

               <p>
                  We then flew up the east cost of Australia to Airlie Beach to explore a plethra of gorgeous
                  beaches and snorkel the Great Barrier Reef!  We took a day cruise to the Whitsunday Islands and 
                  took a snorkeling excursion.

               </h2>
               <p>
                  On one of our last days we swam in the pristine waters of Cedar Creek Falls and climbed to the 
                  top of the waterfall to take in the gorgeous views.
